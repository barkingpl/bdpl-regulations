### Points Allocation

| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Win | 2 points |
| Draw | 1 point |
| Loss | 0 points |
| Awarded match (opponent forfeit) | 2 points |

### Walkovers, No-Shows & Cancellations

**When a team fails to fulfill a fixture** (fewer than 5 players by 21:00, team cancels match, or team withdraws):

**For the Non-Attending/Cancelling Team:**
- Result recorded as **0-10 loss**
- **-10 frame difference** applied
- **£10 fine** issued
- **0 points** awarded

**For the Attending Team:**
- Result recorded as **10-0 win**
- **2 points** awarded
- **Frame difference adjustment:** Only **+6** added to frame difference (not +10)
- Must submit completed match card as per normal procedures

**Match Card Submission (Walkovers/Cancellations):**
- The **attending team's captain** must complete and submit a match card
- Card must list all players who were present and ready to play (or would have been available if notified of cancellation in advance)
- Players should be allocated to frame positions (S1-S8, P1-P2) as if match had been played
- **Deadline:** 15:00 next day (same as regular matches)
- **Standard fines apply** for late submission (£5 after 15:00, £10 after 20:00 Friday)

**Player of the Year Points (Walkovers/Cancellations):**
- Players from the attending team listed on the submitted card will receive:
  - **1 attendance point** (for being present and ready, or available)
  - **2 win points** (standard win points for first frame listed)
  - Total: **3 points** per player listed on card
- Players should be listed in first frame position (S1-S4) to receive win points
- **If no card is submitted:** No players receive any Player of the Year points
- **Committee will NOT remind captains** to submit walkover cards
- It is the **captain's sole responsibility** to ensure card submission

**Food Compensation:**
- If the home venue has prepared food for the visiting team and the away team cancels **on the day of the match**, the **non-attending team must pay £10 compensation** to the home venue
- This compensation is intended to cover costs **already incurred** by the venue in preparing food
- Venues that typically order food in (and can cancel the order) should not claim this compensation if no costs have been incurred — in keeping with the spirit of the game and the friendly nature of the League
- This is in addition to any other fines for failing to fulfill the fixture
- Compensation to be arranged directly with the venue or via the Committee

**Rationale for Frame Difference Adjustment:**
- Prevents excessive frame difference advantage from opponent no-shows/cancellations
- Maintains competitive balance in league standings
- Equivalent to winning 8-2 (8 frames won, 2 lost = +6 difference)
- Non-attending team still receives full -10 penalty

### Tiebreakers (Applied in Order)
1. **Frame Difference** (frames won minus frames lost)
2. **Playoff Match** if still level after frame difference
   - Format: Standard league format (4 singles, 2 doubles, 4 singles)
   - If playoff also drawn: single sudden-death frame between any two signed-in players
3. Playoffs must be completed before Finals & Presentation Night
4. Committee arranges playoff logistics; its decisions on venue and timing are final

## 2.4 Match Format & Rules

### Frame Format
**All Matches:** 4 singles, 2 doubles, 4 singles (10 frames total)

**Playing Order:** S1, S2, S3, S4, P1, P2, S5, S6, S7, S8

### Game Rules
- All frames played under **UK Blackball Rules**
- Official rules: https://eba.leagueapplive.com/pdfs/BB%20Rules.pdf
- In event of contradiction between UK Blackball Rules and BDPL Regulations, **BDPL Regulations take precedence**

### Stalemate Rule
If **five consecutive shots per player** (10 shots total) are played without a legal ball being potted, the frame is declared a **stalemate**.

**Procedure:**
- Frame is re-racked
- The player who broke in the original frame breaks again
- Shot count resets for both players after any legal pot

**Note:** This rule supplements UK Blackball Rules to prevent excessively defensive play and ensure frames reach a conclusion within reasonable time.

# PART 3 — MEMBERSHIP & REGISTRATION

## 3.1 Team Registration

### Annual Requirements
**Registration Fee:** £140 per team (or amount set by Committee at AGM)

**Payment:** Must be paid in full before first fixture

**Player Numbers:** Must register 6-12 players before season starts

**Information Required:**
- Team name
- Venue details
- Primary captain contact

### Eligibility
- Teams must be based in or primarily represent venues in **Barking & Dagenham, Redbridge, or Havering**
- Committee has discretion to accept teams from adjacent areas if it maintains competitive balance

## 3.2 Player Registration

### Initial Registration
**Each player must provide:**
- Full name
- Signature
- Phone number
- Email address

**Important Rules:**
- Players must be **present to sign** registration forms
- Pre-signing is **not permitted**
- Forms submitted by deadline set by Committee (typically 2 weeks before season start)

### Player Replacement
**Permitted Until:** Three-quarters through the season

**Fee:** Amount set annually by Committee and communicated via official channels, currently £2.50 per player. Each team is entitled to register up to 12 players at no additional cost beyond the annual team fee. This is based on the total number of players registered to the team throughout the season, not the current active roster size. Once a team has registered 12 players in total (regardless of any removals), any subsequent registrations will be subject to the £2.50 charge per player.

**Example:** A team starts with 8 players, registers player 9, removes one player (leaving 8 active), then registers player 10. They have now used 10 of their 12 free registrations, leaving 2 free registrations remaining.

**Process:**
- Replacement players complete full registration process
- Registration must be submitted via the **official Google Form on the League website** - this is the **only accepted method** for signing new players
- Registration must be submitted by **20:00 the day before a fixture** for the player to be eligible for that match
- The **timestamp recorded by the Google Form** will be used to confirm whether the signing was registered on time
- Become eligible once registration processed and confirmed by Committee

**Example:** For a Wednesday night fixture, the Google Form submission must be timestamped by 19:59 on Tuesday at the latest. Once the form is submitted the player is registered for play unless the comittee later states otherwise.

## 4.6 Fixture Rescheduling

### General Policy

**Each team is entitled to ONE rescheduled fixture per season.**

**Requirements:**
- Must notify both the Committee AND the opposing team at least **24 hours before** the originally scheduled match start time
- Rescheduled fixture must be played before the deadline specified in the Season Schedule document
- Notification should be made via the Divisional WhatsApp group

**Important Notes:**
- Teams are expected to fulfill fixtures as scheduled wherever possible
- A fixture can be played with a minimum of 5 players - rescheduling should not be used to gain a competitive advantage
- The one reschedule allowance is to accommodate genuine unforeseen circumstances
- Once a team has used their one reschedule, no further requests will be granted for any reason

**Rescheduling Lock**
Once any fixture between two teams has been rescheduled, no further fixtures between those same two teams can be rescheduled by either team until the original rescheduled fixture has been completed. This ensures both captains prioritize completing the rescheduled fixture."

**If Team Requests a Second Reschedule:**
- Request will be automatically denied
- Team must fulfill the fixture as scheduled or forfeit the match (10-0, -10 frame difference, £10 fine)

**Failure to Provide 24 Hours Notice:**
- If a team attempts to reschedule with less than 24 hours notice, the request will be denied
- Team must fulfill the fixture as scheduled or forfeit the match

**Arranging the Rescheduled Fixture:**
- Both teams should agree on a new date before the Season Schedule deadline
- If teams cannot agree, the Committee will set the date
- The rescheduled fixture takes priority and must be completed before the deadline
- Failure to complete the rescheduled fixture by the deadline will result in the match being voided or awarded at Committee discretion

**Rationale:**
- One reschedule per season provides flexibility for genuine circumstances
- Maintains fixture completion and prevents backlog of fixtures
- Prevents teams from gaining unfair advantages through selective rescheduling
- Ensures competitive fairness for all teams

- **Immediate suspension** pending Committee review
- **Expulsion is likely outcome**
- Committee may involve venue management or authorities
- Evidence (witness statements, video) should be gathered

### Match Night Disputes

**Recommended Approach:**
- Captains are expected to resolve minor disputes between themselves on the night
- The Committee expects captains to take responsibility for applying rules sensibly with common sense and good faith
- Minor issues should be dealt with by captains without requiring Committee intervention
- If genuine disagreement exists that cannot be resolved: follow grievance procedure (Part 6)
- Disputes should not escalate to arguments or aggressive behaviour
- Referee's decision stands on the night; grievances addressed afterwards

## 4.9 Spirit of the Game & Committee Interpretation

### Fundamental Principle

**"Spirit of the game" means:**
- Honesty

- Precedent (if any)
- Fairness to all parties
- What reasonable, sporting participant would expect

### Good Faith Expectation

✓ Captains should not require Committee intervention for minor issues  
✓ Deliberately creating situations for unfair advantage violates spirit of game

# PART 6 — GRIEVANCES & DISPUTES

## 6.1 Who May Raise a Grievance

**Team Captains Only**
- Only team captains may officially raise a grievance on behalf of their team
- If a registered player wishes to raise a grievance, they must notify their captain
- The captain decides whether to take the matter forward
- Individual players cannot submit grievances directly to the Committee

**Scope of Grievances**
Grievances may concern:
- Conduct or behaviour issues
- Refereeing decisions
- Match disputes or result disagreements
- Breaches of League rules by opponents
- Venue or equipment issues affecting match fairness

**Captain Responsibility**
- The Committee expects captains to take responsibility for applying rules in good faith

  - A serious breach has occurred
  - The spirit of the game has been violated

## 6.2 Match Result Confirmation & Right to Grieve

**Signing the Result Sheet**
- Both captains must sign the result sheet at the end of every match
- By signing, captains confirm they accept the match result as recorded
- Signing the result sheet constitutes acceptance of all frame results, player eligibility, and the final score
- Signing the result sheet waives the right to later challenge the match result

**Exception: Conduct Grievances**
- Grievances about player conduct, behaviour, or actions during the match may still be raised even if the result sheet has been signed
- Examples: abusive behaviour, intimidation, damage to property, serious unsporting conduct

**Refusing to Sign**
- If a captain refuses to sign the result sheet, they must:
  1. Notify the Committee of their grievance by midnight on the day following the match (see Section 6.3)
- The opposing captain should still sign and submit the result sheet as normal
- Refusing to sign does NOT automatically invalidate the result; the Committee will determine the outcome

## 6.3 Grievance Submission Deadline

**Strict Deadline**
- Grievances regarding match results must be submitted by MIDNIGHT on the day following the match
- "Day following" means the calendar day after the match (e.g., match on Tuesday, deadline Wednesday 23:59)

**Conduct Grievances**
- Conduct and behaviour grievances should still be submitted as soon as possible
- Ideally within 48 hours of the incident

## 6.7 Vexatious or Frivolous Grievances
